**Date:** Day 13, Moon 3, Year 1 ABM, 22:47  
**Subject:** Day One

Jean,

I'm writing from my quarters in Pioneer Village, Block 4C. The personal slate they issued me seem to work and I hope this reaches you through whatever systems and firewalls they've put up. I hope you're somewhere safe with enough to eat.

We arrived this afternoon. Thirty of us on the boat, processed through immigration efficiently and professionally. They scanned our retinas, verified our documentation, and had us recite the Fresh Start Pledge together. It felt significant. Like we were confirming something important. That we're ready to start building something new for ourselves. As of this morning, I am known as Kiran Awwal, the new name that you chose for me. I'm not sure how long it will take for me to get used to this new name but each time I see it, I am reminded of you and what it means.

They gave me everything I need. A duffle bag with clothing, deep blue overalls that remind me of military issue but cleaner, better made. Standard toiletries. All accounted for, all new. It reminded me of basic training, except this time I chose it. We chose it. This is our path forward.

The city is still taking shape. From the boat, approaching the harbor, I could see the ambition. Construction equipment everywhere, scaffolding everywhere I look. Everything is modular and are precision-engineered pieces fitting together perfectly. Up close, the quality is impressive. These aren't temporary structures. They're building something that will last.

My quarters exceed expectations. A bed that folds into a desk that folds into storage. Magnetic seals, soft lighting, smooth surfaces. No wasted space. Everything serves a purpose. I opened the wardrobe and everything was already there, sized for me, organized by function. The attention to detail is remarkable. I thought about how you'll love this place. 

There were no children here today, no families yet. Just the initial workforce getting systems operational. The woman who processed my arrival, Ava Sifar, had this calm confidence about her. I think she's related to Mo Sifar himself. Anyway, it looked like she knows exactly how everything will unfold, so I asked about family reunification during orientation. She told me that its a phased approach and she kept to the line that we've heard before: Year 3 is when families integrate, once infrastructure and systems are stable. It makes sense. They need to get the foundations right first. Build the city properly before bringing in families. I'm going to work hard, prove myself valuable and try to rise. Although I'm just a pair of hands in the Waste Processing department, I'm sure that if I'm essential to their success, we'll be first in line when Year 3 comes.

The money should start coming through next month once payroll processes. I'll send everything I can after covering my basics here. They provide meals, housing, everything I need, so most of my salary can go to you. Please let me know when it arrives. Let me know you're okay.

Tomorrow, orientation continues but at the Waste Centre itself. It's trash that becomes how the city pays for and build everything here.

This feels right, Jean. Like we're finally moving forward after years of just surviving. This is how we rebuild. This is how we get our life back.

I miss you. I miss waking up next to you. But this separation is temporary. Two years feels long, but it's not forever. And when you get here, we'll have a real home. A real future. The life we were supposed to have before everything fell apart.

The quarters are quiet, but it's a peaceful quiet. I'm going to settle in and try to sleep. Tomorrow begins our new chapter. More tomorrow.

-Kiran
